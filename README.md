Analyzing Gender-Based Spending Patterns: A Deep Dive into Walmart's Black Friday Sales
1. Conducted comprehensive data analysis, including univariate and bivariate visualizations, missing value and outlier detection, and correlation heatmaps. Applied statistical techniques such as confidence intervals and central limit theorem to assess gender-based spending behavior.
2. Insights: Analyzed data, revealing no strong correlations between attributes. Found males dominate Black Friday
purchases, with the majority aged 26-35 from City B. Unmarried individuals make more purchases, and
leveraging this, Walmart can capitalize on male-focused promotions, potentially boosting sales.
